<meta name="description" content="Jiantao Li Dr. Tagnani ENGL 101 October 20, 2022 The Corporatization in Higher Education In Chapter 10 of “The Coddling of the American Mind”, authors Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt mention the concept of university corporatization. As today’s universities become more diverse, more administrators and managers are hired and given more power. This trend is the corporatization of universities. Taking this as the theme, I will explain how the corporatization of the university is formed, and the influences and results of the corporatization of the university, based on the relevant materials I have found. Firstly, the formation of university corporatization is caused by the increase in the number of students and tuition fees, so most schools choose to become more diversified to attract more students and thus earn more tuition fees. Combined with the data given in the article &quot;The Coddling of the American Mind&quot;, we can understand why universities choose corporatization. The article expresses in 1869, there were only 63,000 students in American institutions of higher learning and today, there are about 20 million students in higher education institutions. In other words, because there are more students, tuition is higher, and the university makes more money. So, universities want to attract more students and increase their revenue, and they turn themselves to diversification, for example in research, education, fundraising, branding, and legal compliance. With the advent of these programs, the university needs more staff to manage the relevant departments. Therefore, the formation and development of the administrative department gave birth to the prototype of corporatization. Not only that, as well as in the article “The corporatization of higher education”, author Rebecca Clay simply pointed out that the rise of consumerism and the continuous push for accountability has led to the corporatization of higher education. In this article, Harvard University President Derek Bok explains that the corporatization of higher education is nothing new, “What is new about today’s commercial practices is not their existence but their unprecedented size and scope.” (Universities in the Marketplace: The Commercialization of Higher Education, Princeton, 2004). Bok believes that the growing commercialism of society is a factor in the corporatization of high education but is not the only force at work. Cynthia Belar, Ph.D., APA’s executive director for education, believes that social accountability also contributes to the corporatization of higher education, saying “There’s a perception by the public that there has been waste in higher education and that there needs to be more accountability for the dollars spent.”(10). Thus, it is not difficult to understand how the corporatization of higher education came into being. Diversity in universities, the prevalence of consumerism and commercialization, and the push for accountability have all contributed to this result. Secondly, among higher education institutions, the most affected by corporatization are part-time and full-time professors at community colleges. Adopting a business model in higher education is a particular challenge for community colleges, according to Juli A. Jones’ article “Foundations of Corporations: Lessons from the Community College.” Because community college students expect financial success and rapid progress through convenient programs, their administrators insist on increasing productivity at all costs by increasing class sizes and improving student retention, including lowering academic standards. Therefore, community college professors will become more frequently used due to the influence of corporatization, especially part-time professors, and become more passive and difficult due to the expectations of students and the lowering of academic standards. Furthermore, a 2006 report by the American Historical Association found that 68 percent of community college historians worked there as adjunct faculty. With low funding for community colleges, community colleges must rely on overwhelming part-time jobs, some of which are graduate students at local colleges. “Their poor pay requires many to take overloaded schedules with no job security, without basic support such as office space, pay for office hours, library or internet privileges, and of course without benefits.” (Jones 214) Part-time faculty at community colleges must bear a lot of work and risks, as well as meager wages because of the commercialization or corporatization of the college. And it’s just as bad for full-time professors in higher education institutions. Consequently, because of commercialization and corporatization, fewer full-time professors are employed, which means that full-time faculty within colleges must take on more workloads and courses. Finally, the result of the corporatization of higher education is that universities see students as consumers. Because corporatization makes universities more profitable, they need to meet the needs of “consumers” as much as possible, so that more “consumers” can generate more profits for “companies.” In “Coddling”, The authors give strong data “From 2003 to 2013, public research universities increased spending on student services by 22.3%, which was far more than the increases for research (9.5%) or instruction (9.4%).” (189) These data show that Universities prefer to meet the needs of students and attract more students, rather than improve their education level. Meanwhile, the article “The corporatization of higher education” also quotes what a psychology professor said, “The concept of students as customers cannot possibly have a positive influence. Pandering to students rather than expecting them to do work to get a decent grade is not a very good idea, to put it mildly. “ (Buck 2) So, it doesn’t seem like a good idea to think of students as consumers. In addition, the author also gives his views on meeting the needs of students in the article “Foundations of Corporations: Lessons from the Community College.” The authors argue that remote and online classes meet the needs of students while allowing universities to do more with less. Efficiency can be increased using technology, with fewer teachers. However, this also has a negative result, “Of course, such a philosophy encourages students to see grades and degrees as commodities and to devalue the process of education, development of -analytical skills, and the traditional liberal arts.”(215) In conclusion, combining these three articles, it is not difficult to see that the corporatization of universities is caused by the rise of consumerism and the continuous accountability system. The most serious and important impact of corporatization is the full-time and part-time professors in community colleges. Because of corporatization, their treatment has been greatly affected. In the end, the result of corporatization is that universities see students as consumers, and it’s hard to define whether this is a good outcome, but these articles give their views.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Corporatization in Higher Education</b></p>

<p>In Chapter 10 of “The Coddling of the American Mind”, authors Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt mention the concept of university corporatization. As today’s universities become more diverse, more administrators and managers are hired and given more power. This trend is the corporatization of universities. Taking this as the theme, I will explain how the corporatization of the university is formed, and the influences and results of the corporatization of the university, based on the relevant materials I have found.</p>
