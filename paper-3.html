<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Research Argument: <br />The impact of the corporatization of higher education is doing more harm than good</b></p>

<p>With the changes of the times, the increase in population, and the advancement of science and technology, the importance of receiving education has been paid more and more attention, and it is not difficult to find that in the current education system, there are many non-local students, which we call international students who study in different countries in search of a better education. This phenomenon is particularly evident in higher education. In recent years, more universities have begun recruiting international students, and the emergence of international students has brought many advantages to schools, such as high tuition fees, making universities more internationalized and diversified. In order to adapt to this trend of internationalization and diversification, more and more universities are becoming corporate. For example, employ more flexible adjunct professors instead of full-time professors, and recruit more administrative staff instead of professors. However, this raises a controversial question of the pros and cons of corporatization in higher education institutions.</p>

<p>I think corporatization in higher education is doing more harm than good. It is reasonable for universities to diversify and internationalize because they need more students to bring benefits, and students just need to seek better education, which is a win-win situation for both schools and students. But the emergence of corporatization is not all good for schools, professors, and students, and even the harm outweighs the good. In this regard,</p>

<p>First, although there is no doubt that corporatization provides students with more opportunities, I think the impact of university corporatization on students is negative, especially financially.
According to the article “Corporatizing Higher Education” (Lerner) mentioned the impact of university corporatization, “The simultaneous increase in the use of contingent faculty; the rise in tuition; the dramatic decrease in federal and state aid to universities and state colleges and the outsourcing of campus bookstores, food services, and custodial work.” So, we know that the corporatization of universities involves rising tuition fees, increasing the use of temporary teachers, etc. Thus, the first disadvantage of the corporatization of higher education appears, that, for students, high tuition fees are stressful. According to the data provided by the article “The Corporatization of Higher Education” (Mills), “At elite schools, 74 percent of the student body come from the top quarter of the socioeconomic scale, while just 3 percent come from the bottom quarter.” Therefore, I think that due to the emergence of the corporatization of higher education, the increase in tuition fees has created financial pressure on many students, because many students’ families cannot afford high tuition fees, which prevents them from going to good schools. Students can go to relatively average schools with lower tuition fees, but before the tuition fees become higher (or we can say before the emergence of corporatization), they can go to better schools, and corporatization has greatly reduced this possibility. It also means that many gifted students will not be able to get into elite schools because they cannot afford the high tuition fees. What’s more, most of the students are very ordinary and have no family background. In this regard, I think that in addition to elite schools, the tuition fees of many schools are also ridiculously high. I am an international student, so my tuition fees will be much more expensive than local students, and because of the global economic problems in recent years, the high tuition fees and exchange rates have put my family under heavy pressure.</p>

<p>In addition, the impact of corporatization is not only the pressure on tuition fees, the cost of special courses such as extracurricular tutoring is also beyond the reach of ordinary families. According to the “star system” mentioned in the article “Corporatizing Higher Education”, “Research universities and private institutions, always intent on improving their ranking and national stature, tend to select prospective ‘ stars” in their job searches.” This would make both the school and the student seek “market value”. Combined with the information provided in the article “The Corporatization of Higher Education”, “But an altogether different process is going on, one that has saddled us with a higher-education model that is both expensive to run and difficult to reform as a result of its focus on status, its view of students as customers” We can understand that the purpose of the corporatization of universities is to attract students, and the school can gain benefits.</p>

<p>Thence, as an extension and derivative of university corporatization, the “star system“ has increased the status of the school and attracted many students at the same time. Therefore, good students will choose better educational institutions, and as I mentioned above, these good educational institutions often charge higher tuition fees. At the same time, good educational institutions seek out and attract good students. Because of this, the value of a student’s SAT, GPA, and test results are highly valued to improve a school’s ranking and status. For this reason, many students choose to participate in training and counseling so that they can be admitted to good schools. However, this has led to wealthy families having a better chance of being admitted to schools because they can afford to tutor, while middle-class families and disadvantaged groups are not admitted to schools that care about market value because they cannot afford to tutor. Also, as the article “Corporatizing Higher Education” said, “Thus, the corporatization of institutions has reinforced an already existing disparity in access to higher education between the wealthy, the middle class, and the less privileged.”, because extracurricular fees harbor Tutor-led to a widening gap between rich and poor students in schools.</p>

<p>In summary, I think the corporatization of higher education is negative for students, especially when it comes to fees. Wealthy families have a lot of extra expenses because of the trend of college corporatization, such as higher tuition fees and fees for extracurriculars and special courses. And students from the middle class and disadvantaged groups cannot receive a better education because they cannot pay high tuition fees and cannot be noticed by the “star system” because they cannot pay for extracurricular tutoring courses. What’s more, it is likely to burden many families with loans.</p>

<p>Second, I don’t think the corporatization of universities is good for adjunct professors at all. 
as I mentioned in the first paragraph, the article “Corporatizing Higher Education”  mentioned the impact of university corporatization, “The simultaneous increase in the use of contingent faculty; the rise in tuition; the dramatic decrease in federal and state aid to universities and state colleges and the outsourcing of campus bookstores, food services, and custodial work.“ For professors, the situation they face is an increase in the number of times they are used. 
The corporatization of universities means that they need to save as much cost as possible, so corporatized universities tend to recruit more part-time professors, and reduce costs, in other words, to squeeze the labor force of part-time professors.<br />
“According to Department of Education post-secondary school data for fall 2013, 64 percent of faculty at public four-year research institutions are contingent compared with 80 percent at public two-year colleges and 100 percent at for-profit colleges”. According to data provided by this article “Contingent Faculty of the World Unite! Organizing to Resist the Corporation of Higher Education” (Daniel), we can clearly realize that in recent years, most of the school’s professors are part-time professors. However, the article also states that “In 1975, there were 623,000 faculty in the United States (excluding graduate students), 29 percent of them tenured, and another 16 percent on the tenure track. In 2011, there were just under 1.5 million faculty (excluding graduate students), just over 16.7 percent of them tenured, and 7.4 percent on track for tenure, according to a 2013 AAUP report.” While the total number of professors increased by nearly 1 million from 1975 to 2013, only 16.7% of professors were tenure-tracked, up from just 0.7% in 1975. This means that it is now increasingly difficult for professors to secure tenure or adequate security. Therefore, the corporatization of universities has directly led to an increase in the number of part-time professors, while the wages and benefits have decreased, and sufficient guarantees cannot be obtained.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the salary of adjunct professors also has a large gap with that of full-time professors. Combined with the “star system” mentioned above, “Corporatizing Higher Education” provides a clear table that proves the gap between the highest salary of professors (star professors in the star system) and the lowest salary (adjunct professors). The table shows that at private schools, the highest salary for professors ranged from $86,000 in 1985 to $193,000 in 2006. In contrast, the minimum wage only ranges from $11,000 to $27,000. Moreover, the gap in public schools is even greater. has risen from nearly $70,000 to nearly $240,000, but the minimum wage has risen from $15,000 to $21,000. Even from 1989 to 2000, the minimum wage still went down. The article also pointed out, “The actuality is even worse—part-time faculty get paid as low as $1500 per semester course, without health and retirement benefits, and frequently they work without permanent offices. They are hired semester to semester and have no job guarantee.” Combining these data, it is not difficult to see that due to the gradual advancement of corporatization, the lower the status of adjunct professors, the less secure they are.</p>

<p>To sum up, as mentioned in the article “The Corporatization of Higher Education” the problems faced by adjunct professors are not only the workload and remuneration, but they are also helpless when it comes to students. “Casual teachers cannot help students with advising, career planning, or attention to personal learning issues. Casual teachers often have a greater workload than regular teachers; they teach Classes that are larger and most’ lectures are frequent. Under such working conditions, even those highly qualified and motivated teachers cannot do their job as well as the teaching staff get decent salaried jobs. “ Due to the emergence and prevalence of corporatization, universities began to hire more adjunct professors to reduce costs. This also means that although the employment rate of adjunct professors has increased, their remuneration has not increased or even decreased due to the increase in the number of part-time professors. For example, the salary is much lower than that of normal professors, the chances of obtaining tenured teaching positions are reduced, the workload is increased, and there are no retirement benefits and a series of guarantees. These are of no benefit to the adjunct professors whose total number has risen considerably.</p>

<p>Third, unlike part-time professors, although the salary of full-time professors has been increased, it has also been greatly affected by the emergence of corporatization. As universities hire adjunct professors in large numbers, full-time professors are also at risk of layoffs. Due to corporatization, the means for universities to reduce costs is not only to hire low-paid part-time professors but also to lay off some full-time professors to reduce wages.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the article “Faculty Activism and the Corporatization of the University” (Bose), corporatization actually changed the working conditions of professors. “Within the university, corporatization has radically altered the conditions of work for the professorate, in some cases eliminating programs or units in their academic specialties, ratcheting up standards of productivity, and increasing faculty’s general workload in response to the downsizing of academic personnel.” Corporatization not only increases the workload of the professors mentioned above but also lays off the school’s professors. This also means that corporatization has led to the insecurity of both full-time and part-time professors.</p>

<p>Besides, the power of full-time and tenured professors has also been reduced due to the corporatization of universities. According to the idea mentioned in the article “Corporatizing Higher Education”, because professors need to assign and transfer power to more administrative staff. “The impact on governance in academic institutions will be more serious. It is tenured professors who take most responsibility for committee work and participation in the governance of the institutions.” As the temp workforce increases, the number of full-time and tenured professors decreases, and the less influential they become. At the same time, their powers were handed over to executives who had been augmented by corporatization. Not all good for full-time professors. Because they will face the risk of layoffs and the transfer of power.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the reason why I think corporatization does more harm than good to higher education is that for students, it raises tuition fees and increases the cost of extracurricular tutoring and special courses, which ordinary families cannot afford, and it also made the class gap within the university even wider. At the same time, corporatization has made part-time professors face the impact of increased workload and reduced remuneration and also made full-time professors face the problems of layoffs and power transfer to administrative staff. More than that, in fact, corporatization also has an impact on the school itself, such as increasing construction costs and spending money to recruit more administrative staff. But I think that for schools, the pros and cons are about the same. They paid the price and got something, while students and professors didn’t benefit a lot from it.</p>
